# Experiment for undergraduate disseration
## 1. Introduction
This library is a derivative of the LibAUC library, a deep learning library designed for X-Risk Optimization. I have made several revisions to its files to suit the requirements of my experiment.

## 2. Requirements
The required dependencies comprise pandas, scipy, numpy and pytorch, along with all other libraries needed by the original LibAUC. Additionally, the CheXpert datasets are needed, which should include a train_valid_test.csv file as well as train and valid folders.
