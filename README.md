# Experiment for undergraduate disseration
## 1. Introduction
This library is a derivative of the LibAUC library, a deep learning library designed for X-Risk Optimization. I have made several revisions to its files to suit the requirements of my experiment.

## 2. Requirements
The necessary dependencies include pandas, scipy, numpy, pytorch, as well as all additional libraries required by the original LibAUC.
